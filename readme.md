# TimHanewich.AgentFramework
I built a lightweight .NET (C#) library for building AI agents with large language models.

## AgentFramework Class Library
The [TimHanewich.AgentFramework](./src/AgentFramework/) library allows for you to build AI agents with large language models. It has a lightweight and modular design that makes it easy to assemble agents, provide them with tools, manage message queues, monitor token consumption, and more.

## AIDA
As an example of what you can build with the `TimHanewich.AgentFramework` library, I built **AIDA**, an AI Desktop Assistant. It is a simple AI agent that has several tools available to it to help you. 

AIDA can:
- Schedule reminders on your Outlook calendar
- Send emails through Outlook
- Search the web
- Read web pages
- Read files on your computer
- Write files to your computer
- Check the weather

And best yet, you can chain these together to do so many different things!
